# User Microservice

The **User** microservice is responsible for managing users in the database. Its main function is to register and grant authority to users, providing an efficient and scalable API for user management.

This service follows a hexagonal architecture, ensuring a clear separation between business logic and infrastructure layers. Additionally, it implements security with JWT that different microservices can utilize.
